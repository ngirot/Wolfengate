# Wolfengate

## Overview

This project is a basic 3D game engine inspired by Wolfenstein 3D, implemented in Rust. The engine employs raycasting to simulate a 3D environment in a 2D space, with an emphasis on efficiency and simplicity. Itâ€™s designed to provide the foundational elements needed to build a retro-style first-person shooter (FPS) with features like wall rendering, basic movement, and collision detection.
Features

- Raycasting-based 3D Rendering: The core mechanic for rendering walls and environments.
- 2D Map and Player Movement: Navigate through a 2D grid-based map from a first-person perspective.
- Textured Wall Rendering.
- Collision Detection: collision detection to prevent the player from walking through walls.
- Keyboard Input Handling: Move the player using keyboard inputs (WASD or ZQSD), and action with E.
- Basic weapons: only short range weapons yet.
- Basic enemy and HP: enemies are static.
